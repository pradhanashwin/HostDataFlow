Data Pipeline for Host Fetching, Normalization, and Deduping
This repository contains a Python script for implementing a data pipeline that fetches raw hosts from third-party vendors, normalizes the hosts into a unified format, and dedupes the hosts. The script uses Python 3.10 and MongoDB for data storage.
